TODO
=======
- ~~MEGA-IMPORTANT make recursive parsing of settings.py objects, it's high-priority task right now >:]~~
- consider of splitting web and traffic parts into separated docker containers
- write test environment for unit testing
- instead of sleeping every iteration consider about using [pyinotify](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify)
